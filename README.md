Hardware and Mods to the Playmation Marvel Avengers Toys

This repo is an attempt to get some work done to modify the toys that are psrt of the Avenegersnet Game from Marvel.  This system was very cool and put kids into the Avenegers world by wearing Iron Mans Gauntlet or Hulks Hands.  Extra figures were sold to add missions and other characters to the game.

What I would like to accomplish to figure out out how Iron Mans gauntlet functions - allowing me to send my own commands to the Gauntlet to trigger Jarvis speech and missions.  My end game is to use the gauntlet internals in an external system with the sounds and lights, but to trigger the words and sounds on commmand rather than when the game triggers them.
